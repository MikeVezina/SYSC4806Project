    Current State of the Project:

    Scrum 1: Give a 10-15 minute demo during the lab on March 8th.
    
    Scrum 2: Give a 10-15 minute demo during the lab on March 22rd.
    
    Scrum 3: Public demo during the lab on April 5th.



Project Description:
-----------------------------
Users review products. These products could be identified by a URL to the web site where they are listed. 

A review consists of a star-rating and some text. 

Users can also "follow" other users whose reviews they find valuable. A user can then list products for a given 
category by its cumulative rating, or the cumulative rating of only the users they follow. A user can also list the 
users whose ratings are the most "similar" to their own using the **Jaccard distance** (google it!). Product reviews 
can also be ranked according to the similarity score of the people who reviewed them. Users can also list the most 
followed users. The **degree of separation** (see Kevin Bacon!) according to the "follow" link can also be displayed 
next to each reviewer (the assumption is that the "closer" a user is to you, the more trustworthy he/she should be 
to you).
